# Software Engineering Exercise

## Overview
You are asked to take over development of a new system for tracking quests. This system must be capable of handling any story-driven quest, regardless of genre (fantasy, historical fiction, sports, etc.). The system has several open issues that need to be addressed, which can be found in the Issues section of this repository.

## Instructions
* Fork this repository and make copies of the open issues in this repository.
* Make your updates to the existing codebase in your new repository.
* You may complete tasks from the open issues in any order.
* Leave your commit history visible (do not squash commits).
* Use a separate feature branch & pull request for each issue, and link it to the corresponding issue in your repository.
* If you choose to implement additional features beyond those described in the issues in this repository, please add them as issues in your new repository.

## Development Environment
* Visual Studio 2019 (free Community Edition is [available here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/))
* .NET Core 3.1 (included in the .NET Core workload in the Visual Studio 2019 installer)
* Choice of database technology is left up to you
